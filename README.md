Athos Core
==========

This is a [matrix](https://matrix.org) bot expandable with plugins.

Plugins
-------

Plugins are python modules located inside the `athos/plugins` directory.  
Each plugin has a detailed `README.md` inside its directory. 

Plugins must declare a `Plugin` class, a sub-class of `athos.Plugin`, which is the entry-point to each plugin.

- **CarrefourSQLite**
    
    Provides commands that fetch information from the SQLite database generated by [carrefour-convert](https://github.com/AthosOrg/carrefour-convert/), from the json file provided by Carrefour for the TADHack 2016 project.

Usage
-----

1. Install the athos virtualenv using `./scripts/build-env.sh`
2. By default, the environment will be installed into `./env`, simply activate the virtualenv with `source ./env/bin/activate`.
3. After this, the `athos-core` command will be added to your path. Run `athos-core` with a config file as an argument.
4. Config files are YAML files. Find the default config in the `config` directory.
